Overview:
Construction Quotation Assisstant will allow the rapid calculating and
design setup for retaining walls. It allows the placing of walls and then
the customising of the heights of individual bays and otherwise how the walls 
are to be placed. The cost will always be shown on the side as to show
the up to date cost as changes occur in the layout view. For whatever purpose
the created quotations can be saved and then loaded again.

Important notes:
1) There is full JavaDoc documentation that may be generated from
within NetBeans. We have provided the full NetBeans project files.

2) Execute the program from within the NetBeans environment.
Executing from outside the NetBeans environment using non-Debug mode or 
such similar action is currently unsupported in this release.
(So just use the debug button)

3) Please see the accompanying user guide, it covers the basic operation of 
the program. If you decide you don't wish to read user guides like many don't 
bother, than the buttons should be named well enough that it should be simple
to use.

4) ***IMPORTANT***: It is important to see the last page of the CQA_Overview.pdf
file. It gives a proof showing that there is an inaccurate value in the sample
problem shown in the specification due to a rounding error. So it is expected that
the output should be recieved as: 5|6|8|9|10
Instead of the one in the specification which was: 5|6|7|9|10

5) Enjoy! A lot of work was put into making this program error free as possible.
