# Construction Quotation Assisstant (CQA)

A Java group project that assists with giving quotes on retaining walls. Developed as a group during Software Engineering 3 where the focus was on testing software.

Construction Quotation Assisstant will allow the rapid calculating and design setup for retaining walls. It allows the placing of walls and then the customising of the heights of individual bays and otherwise how the walls 
are to be placed. The cost will always be shown on the side as to show the up to date cost as changes occur in the layout view. For whatever purpose the created quotations can be saved and then loaded again.

See the User Guide or Overview PDFs for additional details.
